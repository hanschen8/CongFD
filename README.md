## Geometry:

- SpaceClaim water tight geometry
- Project rectangles over the ventsâ€™
- Get rid of return air cad


## Meshing:
- Added local sizing
- Mesh sizes: Inlet & Outlet (15), Wall size (50)
- Growth Rate: 1.2
- Size Control Type: Face Size
- Describe Geometry: The geometry consists of only fluid regions with no voids, no change all fluid-fluid boundary layers from "wall" to "internal", yes to apply shared topology
- Must change to shared topology in space claim not in fluent
